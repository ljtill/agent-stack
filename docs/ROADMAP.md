# Curate — Roadmap

Ideas we're curating and thinking about for the project.

- Email distribution and subscriber management
- Multiple concurrent editions
- Additional link ingestion methods (API endpoint, browser extension, email forwarding)
- Manual link-to-edition curation
- Publishing cadence and scheduling
- UI designer agent for iterating on newsletter theme and colours
- Research agentic loop — scheduled agent that scans industry sources for recent articles, ingests them as links for review and analysis
